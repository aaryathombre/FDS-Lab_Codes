/*
EXPERIMENT NO.: 02
TITLE: Write a python program to store marks scored in sunject 'Fundamentals of Data
Structures'by n students in the class.Write functions to compute the following:
1)The average score of class
2)Highest score and lowest score of class
3)Count of students who were absent for the test
4)Display mark with Highest frequency
