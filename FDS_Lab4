TITLE:
Write a Python program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a
transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as following:
D 100 W 200 (Withdrawal is not allowed if balance is going negative. Write functions for withdraw and deposit). D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300, D 300 , W 200, D 100 Then, the
output should be: 500

for i in range(0,n,1):
    transaction = str(input("Enter the transaction to be done in the following format:D-Deposit and W-Withdrawal\nD(amount) or W(amount):\n"))
    process = transaction[0]
    value = transaction[1:]
